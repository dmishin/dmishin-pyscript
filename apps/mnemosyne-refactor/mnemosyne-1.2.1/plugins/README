This directory contains some example plugins with the main purpose of 
illustrating to plugin writers on how to achieve certain functionality.

 * activate_all_categories.py: running custom code after the database is 
   loaded.

 * last_grade.py: running custom code to preprocess question and answer text
   before it is displayed.

 * add_menu_item.py: adding a menu item to the GUI.

 * import_csv.py: adding a new file format for importing.

 * custom_tag.py: intercepting a custom tag of the form <tag_name src="..">
   and run its contents in an external program.

 * always_shuffle_queue.py: always shuffle the queue, overriding the
   prioritising of the scheduled cards.

One might wonder what the purpose is of the Plugin class, as opposed to
running 'register_function_hook' directly. However, a later Mnemosyne version
will allow you to activate and deactivate plugins from the GUI.

Note that if you write plugins which require extra modules, the Windows user
should add those to library.zip.
